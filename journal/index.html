                    My main takeaways from the article <a class="links"  href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">“Best Practices For Form Design”</a> by Salim Ansari, are to provide clear feedback on what’s required from the user to avoid confusion, to aim to not overwhelm and confuse the user with word walls and general labels, and design with accessibility in mind. For feedback, it's mentioned to always provide feedback on the amount of steps a form has and the required information. Regarding error feedback, I understand to make it stand out, to be polite with how you deliver errors, and be specific on what the error is and how to fix it. I agreed with the article to be specific with the error messages because I’ve encountered times when I stop filling forms because I don’t understand an error.

                    To avoid confusion and increase usability, I understand to use one column and to be careful with placeholder text because while it guides, it’s only visible if users haven't filled in their response. I hadn’t really thought about this hindering aspect, but I understand that it can decrease usability if the user keeps forgetting the guide/hint the text gives. Other notable mentions are to use dropdown menus only if there are 6 or more items in them and use radio buttons if less and to provide focus on where to start the form.

                <p class = "para">
                    For accessibility, I learned to be mindful of color and provide identification for color blind individuals, to make sure there is enough contrast between text and background to ensure visibility, and to allow users to control their text size according to their needs. Two best practices that I noticed aren’t sometimes used are the option to reveal your password and providing information on why sensitive information is needed and what it will be used for.

                    One website that I think exemplifies the best practices mentioned is the <a class="links" href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo website</a> because it breaks down multiple steps step-by-step into a new page. Also it provides feedback on how much progress has been made in the steps overall. The action buttons for each step adhere to the practice of making the action prominent.
