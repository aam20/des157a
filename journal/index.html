                    From “<a class= "links" href="https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">
                    10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills
                    </a>" by Michael Gonchar, I understand that when it comes to close reading skills and visual thinking it's important to slow down, observe details, make connections, and ask questions. Gonchar suggests practicing close reading and visual thinking skills regularly and to think of it like a game, resembling detectives that investigate. Close reading and visual thinking sort of remind me of eye-spy, but just involving many more questions and connecting them with details.

                <p class = "para">
                    The attention to details and its back and forth connection with open-ended questions stood out because it seems important to constantly make connections between details and then ask questions and vice versa. The back and forth between details, open-ended questions, and observations of people resembles a sort of continuous conversation in which people can learn new ideas. Another important aspect that Gonchar mentions is practicing such skills to build on others’ observations and to learn from each other. At the end, Gonchar hints that there are other ways to practice the skills, but that they all basically involve observing and thinking without being told the answer, essentially letting creativity and curiosity take over.

                    The website <a class= "links" href="https://summer-afternoon.vlucendo.com/">Summer Afternoon</a> uses both 3D images and interactions to create a game-like effect. I like that it allows the user to interact with the setting through the character (keys, mouse) and that the perspective changes with the motion. Another website I like is <a class= "links" href="https://holidayos.tonik.com/">HolidayOs</a> which uses mostly mouse interactions to imitate a computer’s home screen. It has interactions like a Christmas playlist and a game to find trees throughout the site as a way to reduce our carbon footprint, as mentioned in <a class= "links" href="https://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards.com</a>. The website is inspiring to create something that is impactful and fun to interact with.

            <h2>Best Practices For Modals / Overlays / Dialog</h2>
            <time class="date" datetime="2023-02-07">February 7th, 2023</time>
    
    
            <div class="container">
                <p class = "para">
                    In the article, <a class= "links" href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">“Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows”</a> Naema Baskanderi goes over best practices for modal windows (overlays, dialog windows) which include their usage, anatomy,  mobile use, and accessibility. A big takeaway is to use modals carefully and to not use them to display error, warning, and success messages. For usage, Baskanderi mentions to consider using modals to display important information, to ask the user for input, and to display information connected to the parent window (the window under the modal) or to display information not directly related to the parent window. 
    
                </p>
    
                <p class = "para">
                    Regarding anatomy, Baskanderi notes to make modal titles descriptive, to make button names understandable, and to give users an escape feature, especially always providing keyboard accessible control to close the modal. For sizing and location, I learned to make the size no more than 50% of the screen and to make the location the upper half of the screen, to account for modals moving in mobile view. It’s noted that if you need a scrollbar to consider using a separate parent window/page. Baskanderi also states to give users the control to trigger the modal and to bring focus to the modal through a lightbox effect against a dark background, which indicates the user’s inability to interact with the parent window. For mobile use, I understand that modals aren’t good on mobile because the content is difficult to view.  
    
                </p>
    
                <p class = "para">
                    For accessibility, Baskanderi recommends including keyboard accessibility in modals. It's noted that for opening and closing the modal, the element that opens and closes the modal should be keyboard accessible.  Also when the modal opens, the keyboard focus should move to the top and once the focus moves to the dialog, it should stay there until it's closed.

            <h2>Best Practices For Form Design</h2>
            <time class="date" datetime="2023-01-31">January 31st, 2023</time>


            <div class="container">
                <p class = "para">
                    My main takeaways from the article <a class="links"  href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">“Best Practices For Form Design”</a> by Salim Ansari, are to provide clear feedback on what’s required from the user to avoid confusion, to aim to not overwhelm and confuse the user (with word walls and general labels), and design with accessibility in mind. For feedback, it's mentioned to always provide feedback on the amount of steps a form has and the required information. Regarding error feedback, I understand to make it stand out, to be polite with how you deliver errors, and be specific on what the error is and how to fix it. I agree with the article on being specific with error messages because I’ve encountered times when I stop filling forms because I don’t understand the error. 

                </p>

                <p class = "para">
                    To avoid confusion and increase usability, I understand to use one column and to be careful with placeholder text because while it guides, it’s only visible if users haven't filled in their response. I hadn’t really thought about this hindering aspect, but I understand that it can decrease usability if the user keeps forgetting the guide/hint the text gives. Other notable mentions are to use dropdown menus only if there are 6 or more items in them and use radio buttons if less,and alslo to provide focus on where to start the form. 

                </p>

                <p class = "para">
                    For accessibility, I learned to be mindful of color and provide identification for color blind individuals, to make sure there is enough contrast between text and background to ensure visibility, and to allow users control over text size for their needs. Two best practices that I noticed aren’t sometimes used are the option to reveal your password and the act of providing information on why sensitive information is needed and what it will be used for.
                    <br>

                    One website that I think exemplifies the best practices mentioned is the <a class="links" href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo website</a> because it breaks down multiple steps step-by-step into a new page. Also it provides feedback on how much progress has been made in the steps overall. The action buttons for each step adhere to the practice of making the action prominent.
