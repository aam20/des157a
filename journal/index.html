                    In the article, <a class= "links" href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">“Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows”</a> by Naema Baskanderi goes over best practices for modal windows (overlays, dialog windows) which include their usage, anatomy,  mobile use, and accessibility. A big takeaway is to use modals carefully and to not use them to display error, warning, and success messages. Consider using modals to display important information, to ask the user for input, and to display information connected to the parent window (the window under the modal) or to display information not directly related to the parent window.

                <p class = "para">
                    Regarding anatomy, Baskanderi notes to make modal titles descriptive, to make button names understandable, and to give users an escape feature, especially always a keyboard accessible control to close the modal. For sizing and location, I learned to make the size no more than 50% of the screen and to make the location the upper half of the screen, to account for modals moving in mobile view. It’s noted that if you need a scrollbar to consider using a separate parent window/page. Baskanderi states to give users the control to trigger the modal and to bring focus to the modal through a lightbox effect against a dark background, to indicate the user’s inability to interact with the parent window. For mobile use, I understand that modals aren’t good on mobile because the content is difficult to view.

                <p class = "para">
                    For accessibility, Baskanderi recommends including keyboard accessibility in modals. For opening and closing the modal, the element that opens the modal and what closes it should be keyboard accessible.  Also when the modal opens, the keyboard focus has to move to the top and once the focus moves to the dialog, it should stay there until it's closed.

            <h2>Best Practices For Form Design</h2>
            <time class="date" datetime="2023-01-31">January 31st, 2023</time>


            <div class="container">
                <p class = "para">
                    My main takeaways from the article <a class="links"  href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">“Best Practices For Form Design”</a> by Salim Ansari, are to provide clear feedback on what’s required from the user to avoid confusion, to aim to not overwhelm and confuse the user (with word walls and general labels), and design with accessibility in mind. For feedback, it's mentioned to always provide feedback on the amount of steps a form has and the required information. Regarding error feedback, I understand to make it stand out, to be polite with how you deliver errors, and be specific on what the error is and how to fix it. I agree with the article on being specific with error messages because I’ve encountered times when I stop filling forms because I don’t understand the error. 

                </p>

                <p class = "para">
                    To avoid confusion and increase usability, I understand to use one column and to be careful with placeholder text because while it guides, it’s only visible if users haven't filled in their response. I hadn’t really thought about this hindering aspect, but I understand that it can decrease usability if the user keeps forgetting the guide/hint the text gives. Other notable mentions are to use dropdown menus only if there are 6 or more items in them and use radio buttons if less,and alslo to provide focus on where to start the form. 

                </p>

                <p class = "para">
                    For accessibility, I learned to be mindful of color and provide identification for color blind individuals, to make sure there is enough contrast between text and background to ensure visibility, and to allow users control over text size for their needs. Two best practices that I noticed aren’t sometimes used are the option to reveal your password and the act of providing information on why sensitive information is needed and what it will be used for.
                    <br>

                    One website that I think exemplifies the best practices mentioned is the <a class="links" href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo website</a> because it breaks down multiple steps step-by-step into a new page. Also it provides feedback on how much progress has been made in the steps overall. The action buttons for each step adhere to the practice of making the action prominent.
