            <p class="two">
                For my final project, I plan to refine my Every Picture by adding more interactions and elements that enhance and showcase the card elements more, creating more narratives and interactions that allow the user to learn more about Luna through a loteria or picture-like bingo.

                    The website, <a href="http://www.cyclemon.com/index.html">“Cyclemon”</a> mainly consists of letting the visuals of different bicycles tell the story and verstatiltiy of their video product. The creative vertical scrolling changes the images of the bicycles and the interface is simple with just scrolling and minimal text. The scrolling that changes the bicycles works well as it creates a shifting narrative connected to the bicycle. I wish to perhaps do this put with Luna as the focal point. What can be improved is the minimal amount of text that the page has which doesn’t give much information of what the website i about. The page gives proper feedback to the user through a scrolling bar that allows users to preview the slide through text when you hover. I wish to perhaps implement something similar in my final project and also include more interactive text. I hope to use changing backgrounds to perhaps create the environment of a game that can be played anywhere to learn about Luna or perhaps included changing images for each card.

                <p>
                    The website, <a href="https://www.whiteboard.is/">“Whiteboard.is”</a> consists of a written narrative around the mission and accomplishments of the organization. The narrative is presented through creative interactions that allow text and elements to pop up as you scroll as well as when you hover over them. I like how there are various interactions that the user sort of has to look for and how scrolling triggers certain outlines or doodles of images. I wish to perhaps do this with the doodles included in my project images. Something that can be improved is the way some interactions can be obscured or less visible when you scroll up such as the way the carousel elements are obscured the more you scroll down as scrolling controls the movement of the carousel. I wish to refine the users’s scrolling experience in my project with interactions and animations and attempt to introduce some video elements.

                <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    My project goals are to expand the narrative of Luna through more interactions (like hover and zoom) as well as more elements connected to scrolling and zooming. I wish to possibly include more cards about Luna and refine the hover interactions of them. My aspirations are similar to the two websites that I found because they both us scrolling and the whiteboard.is website especially uses animated interactions based on locations of a page. I wish to explore the creativity possible with scrolling elements that activate other elements to pop up and move. My aspiration of including zoom elements is mainly different than the comaprions since they mostly focus on changing information and visuals through scrolling.

                <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
                <p>
                    For my design strategies I plan to create a cohesive design that works along with the color scheme of my photos to create balance and unity. I hope to explore the design of the cards such as the typefaceas well as the background of my page. I wish to maintain and enhance the contrast between the cards that are colorful and the cream-like background. Perhaps I can incorporate dreamy elements like clouds, the moon, and the stars that connect with Luna. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Additionally, I want to maintain a contrast between the minimal sans-serif typeface used for body text and the serif typeface used for the title which has hearts and which creates a personalized look. There is a certain contrast between the typefaces that produces a homey, personalized, and organic feeling that I wish to convey about Luna. I wish to amplify that homey and organic feel to my page through more doodles and interactive elements.

                <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
                <p>
                    For interactions, I plan to refine the hover itneractions with the cards and perhaps add zoom in elements accompanied with a loteria (picture-bingo) card, at least for the desktop version. I plan to explore scrolling and zooming interactions. I wish to play more with image filters and animations that ease in depending on scrolling and/or areas of the page. I also will experiment more with thoughtful and playful text animations connected to my concept of a bingo-like game and of Luna’s playfulness. My interactions will include a combination of hovering, scrolling, and perhaps zoom and timed animations.

                <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    My experience goals are to craft a cohesive project that portrays the warmness and cuteness that I associate with Luna as well as her cleverness. I hope the typefaces and the card designs create a personalized atmosphere in which the user has control on what they want to view and learn first. I hope to incorporate playful scroll and hover interactions that allow the users to imagine themselves shuffling and/or swiping through cards to learn about Luna. I wish to create a dream-likeloteria that talks about Luna’s quirks and habits.
