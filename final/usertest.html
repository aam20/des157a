                <p>
                    My project is a loteria game which works like a bingo game, but with pictures of Luna. The goal is to get to know Luna and fill in the loteria sheet by getting each of the 12 cards randomly.

                    <li> Test the random button and its action.</li>
                    <li>Test the clickability of the cards.</li>

                <h2>User Test 1</h2>
                <figure>
                    <img  class="tests" src ="images/test1.jpg" alt="user clicking on random button in computer screen">
                    <figcaption>Test 1 - 2023</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    In test one, the user first read the instructions at the top of the page and then attempted to click on an image on the loteria sheet instead of the cards. They seemed confused at first and then they used the random button and then roamed around the page more like hovering over the sheet and the cards. It took them some more random cards for them to finally access the overlay by clicking one of the cards and after that they continued to click on the random card continuously. It seemed they continued to click on random until they visually saw that the card was grayed out in the sheet and then they would click on the card. They tended to scroll down the page to check the loteria sheet and see if the card they got was filled in. Eventually, they filled out all the loteria sheet and even kept clicking on the random button to see if it still worked after the sheet was completed. I noticed though that when trying to complete the sheet, sometimes they would pause and try to check which card was chosen and filled in the sheet. 
                </p>

                <h3>Observations</h3> 
                <p>
                    An observation is that they struggled to find out where to click to find out about Luna, the cards or the sheet. I noticed that they didn’t notice that the random card would output the same card at random even when it had been already selected. They also noticed that it took them a long time to notice that all the cards were clickable to access the overlay info, even when they hadn’t been randomly selected. Another observation is that they had to keep on scrolling after each random card to check which card was grayed out in the loteria sheet.

                <h2>User Test 2</h2>
                <figure>
                    <img class="tests" src ="images/test2.jpg" alt="computer at start of test">
                    <figcaption>Test 2 - 2023</figcaption>
                </figure>
               
                <p>
                    In test two, the users scrolled down and right away clicked on the random button, but they struggled a bit to access the overlay information. After a random card was selected, they found it on the loteria sheet and tried to click on it to access Luna’s information. They quickly figured out they had to click on the card itself to access the information. After the second random card, they again tried to click on the loteria images to see what would happen. They then quickly tried to click on other cards that hadn’t been randomly selected yet, and they found out that Luna’s information was accessible even when the card had not been selected. Once they figured all the cards were accessible without being selected, they accessed more information until again they randomized a card and checked if a nearby non-selected card was clickable, which it was. 
                </p>

                <h3>Observations</h3> 
                <p>
                    An observation is that like in test one, in test two the users struggled to know which part was clickable to get Luna’s information and they assumed it was the images on the loteria sheet. Another observation is that they seemed to quickly notice that all the cards were clickable even though they may not have been randomized yet and they continued to also scroll to check which image had been filled in the sheet and matched with the selected random card.

                <h2>Feedback</h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, the feedback that I received through the post-test questions is the following. All the users mentioned how for the feedback between the cards and the loteria sheet, they struggled to know which card had been selected in the loteria sheet. They also said how they didn’t like that the page moved each time they clicked the random card because they weren’t sure where it was leading them to, such as the image on the sheet that was being grayed out. Some mentioned that they were unsure what thing to click to access Luna’s information. In both tests, the users thought they had to click on the sheet and they mentioned they thought it was clickable because the sheet and its images were bigger than the cards on the left. One user mentioned that they didn’t like how cards that hadn’t been clicked were also clickable and their overlay information was accessible. They suggested only enabling the clicking on the randomly selected card. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the random button and its effects, it was mentioned how the button position was good as it was close to the cards that were randomly selected through the button. They mentioned that the effects of the button were hard to tell in the loteria sheet as you had to scroll through to check what the effect on the loteria card was. Some suggested making the loteria sheet smaller (fit the screen), so it was easier to tell when something was grayed out in it. 
                </p>
                   
                <p>
                    For the instructions, most of the users mentioned how they were clear but in test one, the user mentioned how it was hard to tell which card the instructions were referencing to randomize and click. For the overlays, the users didn’t have much feedback and said that the overlays were pretty good and were functionable. In test one though, the user mentioned to perhaps play around with the length of the text block and condense the size of the text block/wall to make it easier to read.

            <article class="two">
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, I plan to take into consideration my users’ feedback, especially when it comes to the interaction between the random button and the loteria card. I will explore the sizing of the cards versus that of the loteria card, so it’s more noticeable which element is clickable depending on which one is bigger in size and is more accessible. I plan to make the loteria/bingo sheet more compact, so all the sheet is visible and the users can more easily see that a part of the sheet was filled in (grayed out, etc).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hopefully, I can also explore and improve the element that shows the images in the loteria sheet are filled in. Perhaps I can make all the cards initially gray and as they are picked they gain color, and simultaneously, the same happens to the loteria sheet’s images. If not, while the cards are initially not grayed out, the loteria images are and as the cards are picked the cards are grayed out and the loteria images get their grayed out element removed. Additionally, I wish to play with the text length and size in my overlays and also clarify the instructions on which part of the page are clickable. I will attempt to fix and restrict what cards are clickable if they are randomly selected or not.
